<h1 align="center">:heart: THANK YOU :heart:</h1>
<p align="center"> We greatly appreciate your contributions!<br> Thanks for even consider doing some good in here. </p>

## How do I contribute ?
* there is a list of issues in [Issues](https://github.com/jacekelgda/unleasher-bot/issues) section. You can start in there be resolving some of them
* if you want to propose a new feature you came up with for Unleasher Bot, please create new issue with label `idea`
* we welcome all improvements to documentation: README.md and this file

## GIT workflow

* please fork this repository
* create a feature branch for issue you will be fixing
* use smart commits to reference issue you will be fixing
* if you finish your fix for issue create a PR from your forks feature branch to this repository `master` branch

When PR is created there will be a CI check running all requirements for the project, such as `linter` and `tests`.

If your PR fails the build, make sure you fix it and update.

## Setup

If you would like to setup Unleasher Bot project locally, there are a few steps to do so:

### Firebase

Create firebase project

* use *"Add firebase to your web app"* and copy all configuration details
* create `.env` from `.env.TEMPLATE` and fill in firebase config data
* go to authentication and enable `anonymous` sign in method
* setup your security rules under `database > rules`

### Slack

Create development Slack application

* go to api.slack.com and create new application
* your application needs to have those scopes in `OAuth & Permissions`:

| Scopes |
| --- |
| bot |

* and your redirect url defined: http://yourdomain.com/api/auth (or https) *Note: this url for testing can be your localhost as well.*
* your app needs to have bot user created
* your app needs to have `interactive messages` endpoint configured: https://yourdomain.com/api/im ( I recommend heroku.com ) *Note: this url needs to publicly accessible **https** endpoint.*
* your can now copy all slack configuration data from your slack app settings page:

| Basic information | OAuth & Permissions |
| --- | --- |
| slack_app_client_id=xxx | slack_api_token=xxx |
| slack_app_client_secret=xxx | slack_bot_token=xxx |

## Heroku

I do recommend using Heroku for local and server side development.<br>It is very easy to deploy and setup on both environments and it's free.<br>It provides https endpoints by default as well.

Install heroku CLI on your local machine to use [heroku local](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-local) functionalities.

Some of the functionalities of the application ***you will be able*** to test without deploying to public server, like:

* bot websockets RTM connection
* slack web API connection
* hosting add to slack button

You will ***not be able to host public endpoints*** which are needed for two actions:

* authorising application for installing to slack team (other teams)
* interactive messages request handling
* slash commands request handling

For those I recommend deploying to ***Heroku*** but you can also use other services and tunnelling for local environment, such as ***localtunnel*** or ***ngrok*** ( connection quality will depend on your internet)
